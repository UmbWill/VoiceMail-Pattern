# VoiceMail-Pattern
A new pattern idea: VoiceMail Pattern

The problem was simple:
it was not possible use the Producer-Consumer Pattern because Consumer could not be always "online".
In those cases we have to save the "products" somewhere.
But how does the Consumer can know about these products? 
With a VoiceMail!

In this pattern there are lots of Producer and one Customer (changed from consumer).


Normal case: Customer is at home
Abnormal case: Customer not at home
After Abnormal case: Customer come back

See the wiki for more details.
